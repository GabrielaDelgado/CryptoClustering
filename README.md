Crypto Clustering
Contributor: Gabriela Delgado

Overview

This project uses basic concepts of machine learning to create plots to look at the data through scatter, line and elbow plots. It shows the difference when the data is fitted and how the predicted model might differ from the original one, especifically in terms of the number of ideal clusters used.

This Challenge contains a ReadMe file, csv files with the datasets, and a Jupyter notebook file with the code.

Git Bash

I used GitBash to download the repository to my desktop and push and commit the changes made to the code into the repository.
